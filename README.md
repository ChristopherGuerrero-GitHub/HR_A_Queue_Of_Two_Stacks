# HR_A_Queue_Of_Two_Stacks
Initialize project HR - A Queue of Two Stacks

This program is a solution to HackerRank problem Queue of Two Stacks

In this challenge, you must first implement a queue using two stacks.
Then process queries, where each query is one of the following types:

1. 1 x: Enqueue element x into the end of the queue.
2. 2: Dequeue the element at the front of the queue.
3. 3: Print the element at the front of the queue.

The first line contains a single integer, q , denoting the number of queries.
Each line i of the q subsequent lines contains a single query in the form described
in the problem statement above. All three queries start with an integer denoting
the query type, but only query 1 is followed by an additional space-separated value, x,
denoting the value to be enqueued.

For each query of type , print the value of the element at the front of the queue
on a new line.
